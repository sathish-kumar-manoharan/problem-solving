https://leetcode.com/problems/subsets

Time complexity: O(N Ã— 2 ^N) to generate all subsets and then copy them into the output list.

Space complexity: O(N). We are using O(N) space to maintain curr, and are modifying curr in-place with backtracking. 
Note that for space complexity analysis, we do not count space that is only used for the purpose of returning output, so the output array is ignored.
